## Receptive field reconstruction via reverse correlation

This repository contains Python code for stimulus generation and data analysis for receptive field reconstruction of visual neurons using white-noise analysis. 

More on the method of reverse correlation or white-noise analysis is, e.g., reviewed in

_Dayan, P., & Abbott, L. F. (2001). Theoretical neuroscience, vol. 806._

The notebook __reverse_correlation_photodiode.ipynb__ shows how to generate white noise stimuli and how to perform reverse correlation on raw time traces of a visually responsive neuron. For simplicity and for verification, here, we include data which was generated by a photodiode placed on a screen which displayed the white noise stimulus generated by this script. 

The notebook __example_analysis_Mi4_RF.ipynb__ gives an exemplary approach on how to analyse the raw reverse correlation kernels which result from this type of analysis. In the example, we extract and visualize average spatial receptive fields from the _Drosophila_ medulla neuron Mi4.
